    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    
    <p>
      Hi! Im John. 37, a Picese, Married to a very smart and extremely supportive woman, 2 Dogs.
      Sheba; big and scary but the sweetest. And Sergeant; small and very mean. lol.
       Im currently a commercial roofing foreman looking to gain a new
       understanding in a field that I beleive will suite my future financial goals.
       I have always loved technology and have dreamed of being capable of manipulating it.
       Life has presented me with other challenges that I had to deal with first. I chose a 
       path that lead me astray. I had to deal with my consequences and learn how to build myself
       back up. This is my next life hurddle.
